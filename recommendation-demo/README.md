Additional Relevant Functions:

1. Contextual Recommendations:
def get_recommendations_for_context(self, user_id, context, limit=5):
    """Get recommendations based on specific context (e.g., seasonal, device-specific)"""

2. Category-Specific Recommendations:
def get_recommendations_by_category(self, user_id, category, limit=5):
    """Get recommendations filtered to a specific category"""

3. Similar Materials:
def get_similar_materials(self, material_id, limit=5):
    """Get materials similar to a given material (helpful for material detail pages)"""

4. Trending Materials:
def get_trending_materials(self, user_grade=None, category=None, limit=5):
    """Get currently trending materials, optionally filtered by grade/category"""

5. Real-Time Profile Updates:
def update_user_profile(self, user_id, event_type, event_data):
    """Update a user profile with a new interaction without rebuilding everything"""

6. Personalized Search:
def personalize_search_results(self, user_id, search_results, limit=20):
    """Re-rank search results based on user preferences"""

7. Recommendation Explanation:
def explain_recommendation(self, user_id, material_id):
    """Provide human-readable explanation of why a material was recommended"""

8. Cache Management:
def refresh_cache(self, user_ids=None):
    """Refresh recommendation cache for specific users or all users"""


Critical Analysis of Current Approach
Signal Weighting and Recency
Question: How time-sensitive is the teaching materials domain? Do seasonal patterns or curriculum cycles affect relevance?
A potential improvement would be implementing a time-decay function for signals, where more recent behaviors have higher influence on recommendations. For teaching materials, this seems particularly important as teacher needs change throughout the school year.
